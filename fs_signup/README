this should become better docs soon

on client machine (public webserver):

install perl, ssh, CGI.pm
cd FS-SignupClient; perl Makefile.PL; make; su; make install
copy or symlink FS-SignupClient/cgi/signup.cgi into the web server's view
use suExec or setuid to run cgi/signup.cgi as the freeside user
(chmod /usr/local/freeside/fs_signupd_socket 600, chown freeside)

on server machine (Freeside machine):

run fs_signup_server user machine agentnum refnum

  user is a freeside user from mapsecrets
  machine is the client machine
  agentnum and refnum are the fixed values for this signup server

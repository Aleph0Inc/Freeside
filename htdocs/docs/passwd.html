  <h1>fs_passwd</h1>
You may use fs_passwd/fs_passwd as a "passwd", "chfn" and "chsh" replacement on your shell machine(s) to cause password, gecos and shell changes to update your freeside machine.  This can pose a security risk if not configured correctly.  <b>Do not use this feature unless you understand what you are doing!</b>
<br><br>Currently it is assumed that the the crypt(3) function in the C library is the same on the Freeside machine as on the target machine.
<ul>
  <li>Create a freeside account on the shell machine(s).
  <li>Append the identity.pub from the freeside user on your freeside machine to the authorized_keys file of the newly created freeside user on the shell machine(s).
  <li>Copy fs_passwd/fs_passwd to /usr/local/bin on the shell machine(s).  (chown freeside, chmod 4755).  You may link it to passwd, chfn and chsh as well.
  <li>Copy fs_passwd/fs_passwdd to /usr/local/sbin on the shell machine(s).  (chown freeside, chmod 500)
  <li>Create /usr/local/freeside on the shell machine(s). (chown freeside, chmod 700)
  <li>Run an iteration of "fs_passwd/fs_passwd_server shell.machine" as the freeside user for each shell machine (this is a daemon process).
</ul>

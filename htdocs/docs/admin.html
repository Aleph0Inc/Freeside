<ul>
  <li>Open up the root of the Freeside document tree in your web
  browser.  For example, if you created the Freeside document tree in   
  /home/httpd/html/freeside, and your web browser's DocumentRoot is
  /home/httpd/html, open http://your_host/freeside/. Replace
  "your_host" with the name or network address of your web server.

  <li>Once in the Freeside web interface, you must first create a
  service.  An example of a service would be a dial-up account or a
  hosted virtual domain.

  <li>After you create your first service or services, you must then
  create a package of that service or services which you will sell to
  your customer.  To allow flexibility in changing your service
  offerings, Freeside requires that you bundle your services into a
  package before customers may purchase them.  For instance, you could
  create a leased line package which would consist of a one-time
  charge for the customer premise equipment, the monthly service fee
  for the leased line, a backup dial-up account, and a support
  contract.  You could also create a leased line package which omits
  the support contract simply by adding a new package that does not
  include the support contract.
  
  <li>After you create your first package, then you must define who is
  able to sell that package by creating an agent type.  An example of
  an agent type would be an internal sales representitive which sells
  regular and promotional packages, as opposed to an external sales
  representitive which would only sell regular packages of services.

  <li>After creating a new agent type, you must create an agent, and
  assign the the agent type you just created to it.

  <li>If the service you created was of type svc_acct, you may have to
  create a POP from the main menu before you can create your first new
  customer.

  <li>If you are using Freeside to keep track of sales taxes, you must
  define tax information for your locale by clicking on the "View/Edit  
  locales and tax rates" link on the Freeside main menu.

  <li>Finally, you may optionally set up a referral by clicking on the
  "View/Edit referrals" link in the Freeside main menu.  Referrals
  will help you keep track of how effective your advertising is, by
  helping you keep track of where customers heard of your service
  offerings.  You must create at least one referral.  If you do not wish to
  use the referral functionality, simply create a single referral only.
  
  <li>You should now be ready to sign up your first customer by
  clicking on the "New Customer" link at the top of the Freeside main
  menu.

<h1>Upgrading to 1.2.2 from 1.2.x</h1>
<ul>
  <li>If migrating from 1.0.0, see these <a href="upgrade.html">instructions</a> first.
  <li>If migrating from less than 1.1.4, see these <a href="upgrade2.html">instructions</a> first.
  <li>If migrating from less than 1.2.0, see these <a href="upgrade3.html">instructions</a> first.
  <li>Back up your data and current Freeside installation.
  <li>Apply the following changes to your database:
<pre>
ALTER TABLE cust_pay_batch CHANGE exp exp VARCHAR(11);
</pre>
  <li>Copy or symlink htdocs to the new copy.
  <li>Remove the symlink or directory <i>(your_site_perl_directory)</i>/FS.
  <li>Change to the FS directory in the new tarball, and build and install the
      Perl modules:
    <pre>
$ cd FS/
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ su
# make install</pre>
  <li>Run bin/dbdef-create.  This file uses MySQL-specific syntax.  If you are running a different database engine you will need to modify it slightly.

  <h1>Billing</h1>
  The <b>freeside-bill</b> script can be run daily to bill all customers.  Usage: bill [ -c [ i ] ] [ -d <i>date</i> ] [ -b ] <i>user</i>
  <ul>
    <li>-c: Turn on collecting (you probably want this).
    <li>-i: Real-time billing (as opposed to bacth billing).  Only relevant for credit cards.
    <li>-d: Pretend it is <i>date</i> (parsed by Date::Parse)
    <li>-b: N/A
  </ul>
  Printing should be configured on your freeside machine to print invoices.
  <br><br>Batch credit card processing
  <ul>
    <li>After this script is run, a credit card batch will be in the <a href="schema.html#cust_pay_batch">cust_pay_batch</a> table.  Export this table to your credit card batching.
    <li>When your batch completes, erase the cust_pay_batch records in that batch and add any necessary paymants to the <a href="schema.html#cust_pay">cust_pay</a> table.  Example code to add payments is:
    <pre>use FS::cust_pay;

# loop over all records in batch

my $payment=create FS::cust_pay (
  'invnum' => $invnum,
  'paid' => $paid,
  '_date' => $_date,
  'payby' => $payby,
  'payinfo' => $payinfo,
  'paybatch' => $paybatch,
);

my $error=$payment->insert;
if ( $error ) {
  #process error
}

# end loop
</pre>
All fields except paybatch are contained in the cust_pay_batch table.  You can use paybatch field to track particular batches and/or particular transactions within a batch.<br><br>
    <li>The <b>freeside-print-batch</b> script can print or email pending credit card batches for manual entry.  Usage: freeside-print-batch [-v] [-p] [-e] [-a] [-d] <i>user</i>
      <ul>
        <li>-v: Verbose - Prints records to STDOUT.
        <li>-p: Print to printer lpr as found in the conf directory.
        <li>-e: Email output to user found in the Conf email file.
        <li>-a: Automatically pays all records in cust_pay_batch.  Use -d with this option usually.
        <li>-d: Delete - Pays account and deletes record from cust_pay_batch.
      </ul>
  </ul>

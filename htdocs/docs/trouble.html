  <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>When troubleshooting the web interface, helpful information is often in your web server's error log.
    <li>Internet Explorer will not work with Freeside's HTML interface.  <b>This may be fixed in >1.2, please report your experiences!</b>
<a HREF="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape</a>,                                 
<a HREF="http://lynx.browser.org">Lynx</a>, and                                 
<a HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html">Emacs/W3</a>,            
among others, should work fine.
    <li>If bin/svc_acct.import fails with an "Out of memory!" error using MySQL, upgrede MySQL and recompile the Perl DBD.  There was a memory leak in some older versions of MySQL.
    <li>If you get tons of errors in your web server's error log like this:
<pre>
Ambiguous use of value => resolved to "value" =>
at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/File/CounterFile.pm line 132.
</pre>
        This clutters up your log files but is otherwise harmless.  Upgrade to the latest File::CounterFile. 
    <li><b>(No longer applicable in >1.2!)</b> If you get an Internal Server Error when adding or editing, but find that the update has occured, and you get something like the following in your web server's error log:
<pre>
access to <i>/your/path</i>/edit/process/<i>some_table</i>.cgi failed for
<i>machine.domain.tld</i>, reason: malformed header from script.
Bad header=HTTP/1.0 302 Moved Temporarily
</pre>
        Then you forgot to apply this <a href="CGI-modules-2.76-patch.txt">patch</a> as mentioned in the <a href="install.html">New Installation</a> section of the documentation.
    <li>If you get errors like this:
<pre>
UID.pm: Can't open /var/spool/freeside/conf/secrets: Permission denied 
at <i>/your/path</i>/site_perl/FS/UID.pm line 26.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at
<i>/your/path</i>/edit/process/part_svc.cgi line 15.
</pre>
        Then the scripts are not running as the freeside freeside user.  See
the <a href="install.html">New Installation</a> section of the documentation.
  <li>If you receive `can not connect to server' errors using MySQL on a system that doesn't support native threading, you may need to specify the full hostname in your DBI datasource.  See the <a href="http://www.mysql.com/Manual_chapter/manual_Problems.html#Can_not_connect_to_server">MySQL documentation</a>, DBI manpage and the DBD::mysql manpage for details.
  </ul>

  <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>When troubleshooting the web interface, helpful information is often in your web server's error log.
    <li>Internet Explorer will not work with Freeside's HTML interface. 
<a HREF="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape</a>,                                 
<a HREF="http://lynx.browser.org">Lynx</a>, and                                 
<a HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html">Emacs/W3</a>,            
among others, should work fine.
    <li>If bin/svc_acct.import fails with an "Out of memory!" error using MySQL, upgrede MySQL and recompile the Perl DBD.  There was a memory leak in some older versions of MySQL.
    <li>If you get tons of errors in your web server's error log like this:
<pre>
Ambiguous use of value => resolved to "value" =>
at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/File/CounterFile.pm line 132.
</pre>
        This clutters up your log files but is otherwise harmless.  Upgrade to the latest File::CounterFile. 
    <li>If you get an Internal Server Error when adding or editing, but find that the update has occured, and you get something like the following in your web server's error log:
<pre>
access to <i>/your/path</i>/edit/process/<i>some_table</i>.cgi failed for
<i>machine.domain.tld</i>, reason: malformed header from script.
Bad header=HTTP/1.0 302 Moved Temporarily
</pre>
        Then you forgot to apply this <a href="CGI-modules-2.76-patch.txt">patch</a> as mentioned in the <a href="install.html">New Installation</a> section of the documentation.
    <li>If you get errors like this:
<pre>
UID.pm: Can't open /var/spool/freeside/conf/secrets: Permission denied 
at <i>/your/path</i>/site_perl/FS/UID.pm line 26.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at
<i>/your/path</i>/edit/process/part_svc.cgi line 15.
</pre>
        Then the scripts are not running setuid freeside.  If you were editing
the files, it is possible you inadvertantly removed the setuid bit.
As mentioned in the <a href="install.html">New Installation</a> section of the documentation, set ownership and permissions for the web interface.  Your system should support secure setuid scripts or Perl's emulation, see <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/doc/manual/html/pod/perlsec.html#Security_Bugs">perlsec: Security Bugs</a> for information and workarounds.
<pre>cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/freeside
chown -R freeside .
chmod 4755 browse/*.cgi edit/*.cgi edit/process/*.cgi misc/*.cgi misc/process/*.cgi search/*.cgi view/*.cgi</pre>
  </ul>

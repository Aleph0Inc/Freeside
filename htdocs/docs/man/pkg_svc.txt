NAME
    FS::pkg_svc - Object methods for pkg_svc records

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::pkg_svc;

      $record = create FS::pkg_svc \%hash;
      $record = create FS::pkg_svc { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::pkg_svc record links a billing item definition (see the
    FS::part_pkg manpage) to a service definition (see the
    FS::part_svc manpage). FS::pkg_svc inherits from FS::Record. The
    following fields are currently supported:

    pkgpart - Billing item definition (see the FS::part_pkg manpage)
    svcpart - Service definition (see the FS::part_svc manpage)
    quantity - Quantity of this service definition that this billing item
    definition includes

        is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    check

        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false. Called by the insert and replace methods.

NAME
    FS::cust_main_county - Object methods for cust_main_county
    objects

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::cust_main_county;

      $record = create FS::cust_main_county \%hash;
      $record = create FS::cust_main_county { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::cust_main_county object represents a tax rate, defined by
    locale. FS::cust_main_county inherits from FS::Record. The
    following fields are currently supported:

    taxnum - primary key (assigned automatically for new tax rates)
    state
    county
    tax - percentage
METHODS
    create HASHREF
        Creates a new tax rate. To add the tax rate to the database,
        see the section on "insert".

    insert
        Adds this tax rate to the database. If there is an error,
        returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    delete
        Deletes this tax rate from the database. If there is an
        error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    replace OLD_RECORD
        Replaces the OLD_RECORD with this one in the database. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false.

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid tax rate. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false. Called by the insert and replace methods.

BUGS
    It doesn't properly override FS::Record yet.

    A country field (and possibly a currency field) should be added.

    FS::cust_bill manpage, schema.html from the base documentation.

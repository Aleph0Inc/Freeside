NAME
    FS::cust_svc - Object method for cust_svc objects

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::cust_svc;

      $record = create FS::cust_svc \%hash
      $record = create FS::cust_svc { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::cust_svc represents a service. FS::cust_svc inherits from
    FS::Record. The following fields are currently supported:

    svcnum - primary key (assigned automatically for new services)
    pkgnum - Package (see the FS::cust_pkg manpage)
    svcpart - Service definition (see the FS::part_svc manpage)
METHODS
    create HASHREF
        Creates a new service. To add the refund to the database,
        see the section on "insert". Services are normally created
        by creating FS::svc_ objects (see the FS::svc_acct manpage,
        the FS::svc_domain manpage, and the FS::svc_acct_sm manpage,
        among others).

    insert
        Adds this service to the database. If there is an error,
        returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    delete
        Deletes this service from the database. If there is an
        error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.

        Called by the cancel method of the package (see the
        FS::cust_pkg manpage).

    replace OLD_RECORD
        Replaces the OLD_RECORD with this one in the database. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false.

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid service. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otehrwise returns
        false. Called by the insert and replace methods.

BUGS
    Behaviour of changing the svcpart of cust_svc records is
    undefined and should possibly be prohibited, and pkg_svc records
    are not checked.

    pkg_svc records are not checket in general (here).

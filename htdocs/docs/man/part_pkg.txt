NAME
    FS::part_pkg - Object methods for part_pkg objects

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::part_pkg;

      $record = create FS::part_pkg \%hash
      $record = create FS::part_pkg { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::part_pkg represents a billing item definition.
    FS::part_pkg inherits from FS::Record. The following fields are
    currently supported:

    pkgpart - primary key (assigned automatically for new billing item definitions)
    pkg - Text name of this billing item definition (customer-viewable)
    comment - Text name of this billing item definition (non-customer-viewable)
    setup - Setup fee
    freq - Frequency of recurring fee
    recur - Recurring fee
    setup and recur are evaluated as Safe perl expressions. You can
    use numbers just as you would normally. More advanced semantics
    are not yet defined.

METHODS
    create HASHREF
        Creates a new billing item definition. To add the billing
        item definition to the database, see the section on
        "insert".

    insert
        Adds this billing item definition to the database. If there
        is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    delete
        Currently unimplemented.

    replace OLD_RECORD
        Replaces OLD_RECORD with this one in the database. If there
        is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid billing item
        definition. If there is an error, returns the error,
        otherwise returns false. Called by the insert and replace
        methods.

BUGS
    It doesn't properly override FS::Record yet.

    The delete method is unimplemented.

    setup and recur semantics are not yet defined (and are
    implemented in FS::cust_bill. hmm.).

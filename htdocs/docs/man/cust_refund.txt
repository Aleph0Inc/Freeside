    FS::cust_refund - Object method for cust_refund objects

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::cust_refund;

      $record = new FS::cust_refund \%hash;
      $record = new FS::cust_refund { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::cust_refund represents a refund. FS::cust_refund inherits
    from FS::Record. The following fields are currently supported:

    refundnum - primary key (assigned automatically for new refunds)
    crednum - Credit (see the FS::cust_credit manpage)
    refund - Amount of the refund
    _date - specified as a UNIX timestamp; see the section on "time" in the perlfunc manpage.  Also see
    the Time::Local manpage and the Date::Parse manpage for conversion functions.
    payby - `CARD' (credit cards), `BILL' (billing), or `COMP' (free)
    payinfo - card number, P.O.#, or comp issuer (4-8 lowercase alphanumerics; think username)
    otaker - order taker (assigned automatically, see the FS::UID manpage)
METHODS
    new HASHREF
        Creates a new refund. To add the refund to the database, see
        the section on "insert".

    insert
        Adds this refund to the database, and updates the credit
        (see the FS::cust_credit manpage).

        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false. Called by the insert method.

NAME
    FS::type_pkgs - Object methods for type_pkgs records

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::type_pkgs;

      $record = new FS::type_pkgs \%hash;
      $record = new FS::type_pkgs { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::type_pkgs record links an agent type (see the
    FS::agent_type manpage) to a billing item definition (see the
    FS::part_pkg manpage). FS::type_pkgs inherits from FS::Record.
    The following fields are currently supported:

    typenum - Agent type, see the FS::agent_type manpage
    pkgpart - Billing item definition, see the FS::part_pkg manpage
METHODS
    new HASHREF
        Create a new record. To add the record to the database, see
        the section on "insert".

    insert
        Adds this record to the database. If there is an error,
        returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    delete
        Deletes this record from the database. If there is an error,
        returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    replace OLD_RECORD
        Replaces OLD_RECORD with this one in the database. If there
        is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid record. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false. Called by the insert and replace methods.

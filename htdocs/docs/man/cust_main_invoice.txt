NAME
    FS::cust_main_invoice - Object methods for cust_main_invoice
    records

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::cust_main_invoice;

      $record = new FS::cust_main_invoice \%hash;
      $record = new FS::cust_main_invoice { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

      $email_address = $record->address;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::cust_main_invoice object represents an invoice
    destination. FS::cust_main_invoice inherits from FS::Record. The
    following fields are currently supported:

    destnum - primary key
    custnum - customer (see the FS::cust_main manpage)
    dest - Invoice destination: If numeric, a <a href="#svc_acct">svcnum</a>, if string, a literal email address, or `POST' to enable mailing (the default if no cust_main_invoice records exist)
METHODS
    new HASHREF
        Creates a new invoice destination. To add the invoice
        destination to the database, see the section on "insert".

        Note that this stores the hash reference, not a distinct
        copy of the hash it points to. You can ask the object for a
        copy with the *hash* method.

    insert
        Adds this record to the database. If there is an error,
        returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    delete
        Delete this record from the database.

    replace OLD_RECORD
        Replaces the OLD_RECORD with this one in the database. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false.

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid invoice
        destination. If there is an error, returns the error,
        otherwise returns false. Called by the insert and repalce
        methods.

    checkdest
        Checks the dest field only.

    address
        Returns the literal email address for this record (or
        `POST').

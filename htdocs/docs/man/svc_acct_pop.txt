NAME
    FS::svc_acct_pop - Object methods for svc_acct_pop records

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::svc_acct_pop;

      $record = create FS::svc_acct_pop \%hash;
      $record = create FS::svc_acct_pop { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::svc_acct object represents an point of presence.
    FS::svc_acct_pop inherits from FS::Record. The following fields
    are currently supported:

    popnum - primary key (assigned automatically for new accounts)
    city
    state
    ac - area code
    exch - exchange
METHODS
    create HASHREF
        Creates a new point of presence (if only it were that
        easy!). To add the point of presence to the database, see
        the section on "insert".

    insert
        Adds this point of presence to the databaes. If there is an
        error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    delete
        Currently unimplemented.

    replace OLD_RECORD
        Replaces OLD_RECORD with this one in the database. If there
        is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid point of
        presence. If there is an error, returns the error, otherwise
        returns false. Called by the insert and replace methods.

BUGS
    It doesn't properly override FS::Record yet.

    It should be renamed to part_pop.

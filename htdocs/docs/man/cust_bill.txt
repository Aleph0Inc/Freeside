NAME
    FS::cust_bill - Object methods for cust_bill records

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::cust_bill;

      $record = new FS::cust_bill \%hash;
      $record = new FS::cust_bill { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

      ( $total_previous_balance, @previous_cust_bill ) = $record->previous;

      @cust_bill_pkg_objects = $cust_bill->cust_bill_pkg;

      ( $total_previous_credits, @previous_cust_credit ) = $record->cust_credit;

      @cust_pay_objects = $cust_bill->cust_pay;

      @lines = $cust_bill->print_text;
      @lines = $cust_bill->print_text $time;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::cust_bill object represents an invoice. FS::cust_bill
    inherits from FS::Record. The following fields are currently
    supported:

    invnum - primary key (assigned automatically for new invoices)
    custnum - customer (see the FS::cust_main manpage)
    _date - specified as a UNIX timestamp; see the section on "time" in the perlfunc manpage.  Also see
    the Time::Local manpage and the Date::Parse manpage for conversion functions.
    charged - amount of this invoice
    owed - amount still outstanding on this invoice, which is charged minus
    all payments (see the FS::cust_pay manpage).
    printed - how many times this invoice has been printed automatically
    (see the section on "collect" in the FS::cust_main manpage).
METHODS
    new HASHREF
        Creates a new invoice. To add the invoice to the database,
        see the section on "insert". Invoices are normally created
        by calling the bill method of a customer object (see the
        FS::cust_main manpage).

    insert
        Adds this invoice to the database ("Posts" the invoice). If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false.

        When adding new invoices, owed must be charged (or null, in
        which case it is automatically set to charged).

    delete
        Currently unimplemented. I don't remove invoices because
        there would then be no record you ever posted this invoice
        (which is bad, no?)

    replace OLD_RECORD
        Replaces the OLD_RECORD with this one in the database. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false.

        Only owed and printed may be changed. Owed is normally
        updated by creating and inserting a payment (see the
        FS::cust_pay manpage). Printed is normally updated by
        calling the collect method of a customer object (see the
        FS::cust_main manpage).

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid invoice. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false. Called by the insert and replace methods.

    previous
        Returns a list consisting of the total previous balance for
        this customer, followed by the previous outstanding invoices
        (as FS::cust_bill objects also).

    cust_bill_pkg
        Returns the line items (see the FS::cust_bill_pkg manpage)
        for this invoice.

    cust_credit
        Returns a list consisting of the total previous credited
        (see the FS::cust_credit manpage) for this customer,
        followed by the previous outstanding credits
        (FS::cust_credit objects).

    cust_pay
        Returns all payments (see the FS::cust_pay manpage) for this
        invoice.

    print_text [TIME];
        Returns an ASCII invoice, as a list of lines.

        TIME an optional value used to control the printing of
        overdue messages. The default is now. It isn't the date of
        the invoice; that's the `_date' field. It is specified as a
        UNIX timestamp; see the section on "time" in the perlfunc
        manpage. Also see the Time::Local manpage and the
        Date::Parse manpage for conversion functions.

BUGS
    The delete method.

    print_text formatting (and some logic :/) is in source, but
    needs to be slurped in from a file. Also number of lines ($=).

    missing print_ps for a nice postscript copy (maybe HylaFAX-
    cover-page-style or something similar so the look can be
    completely customized?)

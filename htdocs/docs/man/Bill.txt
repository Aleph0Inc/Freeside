HISTORY
    ivan@voicenet.com 97-jul-24 - 25 - 28

    use Safe; evaluate all fees with perl (still on TODO list until
    I write some examples & test opmask to see if we can read db)
    %hash=$obj->hash later ivan@sisd.com 98-mar-13

    packages with no next bill date start at $time not time, this
    should eliminate the last of the problems with billing at a past
    date also rewrite the invoice priting logic not to print
    invoices for things that haven't happended yet and update
    $cust_bill->printed when we print so PAST DUE notices work, and
    s/date/_date/ ivan@sisd.com 98-jun-4

    more logic for past due stuff - packages with no next bill date
    start at $cust_pkg->setup || $time ivan@sisd.com 98-jul-13

    moved a few things in collection logic; negative charges should
    work ivan@sisd.com 98-aug-6

    pod, moved everything to FS::cust_main ivan@sisd.com 98-sep-19

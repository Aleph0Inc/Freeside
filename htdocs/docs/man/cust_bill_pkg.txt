NAME
    FS::cust_bill_pkg - Object methods for cust_bill_pkg records

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::cust_bill_pkg;

      $record = new FS::cust_bill_pkg \%hash;
      $record = new FS::cust_bill_pkg { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::cust_bill_pkg object represents an invoice line item.
    FS::cust_bill_pkg inherits from FS::Record. The following fields
    are currently supported:

    invnum - invoice (see the FS::cust_bill manpage)
    pkgnum - package (see the FS::cust_pkg manpage)
    setup - setup fee
    recur - recurring fee
    sdate - starting date of recurring fee
    edate - ending date of recurring fee
    sdate and edate are specified as UNIX timestamps; see the
    section on "time" in the perlfunc manpage. Also see the
    Time::Local manpage and the Date::Parse manpage for conversion
    functions.

METHODS
    new HASHREF
        Creates a new line item. To add the line item to the
        database, see the section on "insert". Line items are
        normally created by calling the bill method of a customer
        object (see the FS::cust_main manpage).

    insert
        Adds this line item to the database. If there is an error,
        returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    delete
        Currently unimplemented. I don't remove line items because
        there would then be no record the items ever existed (which
        is bad, no?)

    replace OLD_RECORD
        Currently unimplemented. This would be even more of an
        accounting nightmare than deleteing the items. Just don't do
        it.

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid line item. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false. Called by the insert method.

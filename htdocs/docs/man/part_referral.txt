NAME
    FS::part_referral - Object methods for part_referral objects

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::part_referral;

      $record = create FS::part_referral \%hash
      $record = create FS::part_referral { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::part_referral represents a referral - where a customer
    heard of your services. This can be used to track the
    effectiveness of a particular piece of advertising, for example.
    FS::part_referral inherits from FS::Record. The following fields
    are currently supported:

    refnum - primary key (assigned automatically for new referrals)
    referral - Text name of this referral
METHODS
    create HASHREF
        Creates a new referral. To add the referral to the database,
        see the section on "insert".

    insert
        Adds this referral to the database. If there is an error,
        returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    delete
        Currently unimplemented.

    replace OLD_RECORD
        Replaces OLD_RECORD with this one in the database. If there
        is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid referral. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false. Called by the insert and replace methods.

BUGS
    It doesn't properly override FS::Record yet.

    The delete method is unimplemented.

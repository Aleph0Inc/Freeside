NAME
    FS::svc_Common - Object method for all svc_ records

SYNOPSIS
    use FS::svc_Common;

    @ISA = qw( FS::svc_Common );

DESCRIPTION
    FS::svc_Common is intended as a base class for table-specific
    classes to inherit from, i.e. FS::svc_acct. FS::svc_Common
    inherits from FS::Record.

METHODS
    insert
        Adds this record to the database. If there is an error,
        returns the error, otherwise returns false.

        The additional fields pkgnum and svcpart (see the
        FS::cust_svc manpage) should be defined. An FS::cust_svc
        record will be created and inserted.

    delete
        Deletes this account from the database. If there is an
        error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.

        The corresponding FS::cust_svc record will be deleted as
        well.

    setfixed
        Sets any fixed fields for this service (see the FS::part_svc
        manpage). If there is an error, returns the error, otherwise
        returns the FS::part_svc object (use ref() to test the
        return). Usually called by the check method.

    setdefault
        Sets all fields to their defaults (see the FS::part_svc
        manpage), overriding their current values. If there is an
        error, returns the error, otherwise returns the FS::part_svc
        object (use ref() to test the return).

    suspend
    unsuspend
    cancel
        Stubs - return false (no error) so derived classes don't
        need to define these methods. Called by the cancel method of
        FS::cust_pkg (see the FS::cust_pkg manpage).

BUGS
    The setfixed method return value.

    The new method should set defaults from part_svc (like the check
    method sets fixed values)?

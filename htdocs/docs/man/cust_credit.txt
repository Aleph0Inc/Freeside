NAME
    FS::cust_credit - Object methods for cust_credit records

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::cust_credit;

      $record = new FS::cust_credit \%hash;
      $record = new FS::cust_credit { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::cust_credit object represents a credit. FS::cust_credit
    inherits from FS::Record. The following fields are currently
    supported:

    crednum - primary key (assigned automatically for new credits)
    custnum - customer (see the FS::cust_main manpage)
    amount - amount of the credit
    credited - how much of this credit that is still outstanding, which is
    amount minus all refunds (see the FS::cust_refund manpage).
    _date - specified as a UNIX timestamp; see the section on "time" in the perlfunc manpage.  Also see
    the Time::Local manpage and the Date::Parse manpage for conversion functions.
    otaker - order taker (assigned automatically, see the FS::UID manpage)
    reason - text
METHODS
    new HASHREF
        Creates a new credit. To add the credit to the database, see
        the section on "insert".

    insert
        Adds this credit to the database ("Posts" the credit). If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false.

        When adding new invoices, credited must be amount (or null,
        in which case it is automatically set to amount).

    delete
        Currently unimplemented.

    replace OLD_RECORD
        Replaces the OLD_RECORD with this one in the database. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false.

        Only credited may be changed. Credited is normally updated
        by creating and inserting a refund (see the FS::cust_refund
        manpage).

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid credit. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false. Called by the insert and replace methods.

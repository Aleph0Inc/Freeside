SYNOPSIS
      use FS::cust_main;

      $record = new FS::cust_main \%hash;
      $record = new FS::cust_main { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

      @cust_pkg = $record->ncancelled_pkgs;

      $error = $record->bill;
      $error = $record->bill %options;
      $error = $record->bill 'time' => $time;

      $error = $record->collect;
      $error = $record->collect %options;
      $error = $record->collect 'invoice_time'   => $time,
                                'batch_card'     => 'yes',
                                'report_badcard' => 'yes',
                              ;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::cust_main object represents a customer. FS::cust_main
    inherits from FS::Record. The following fields are currently
    supported:

    custnum - primary key (assigned automatically for new customers)
    agentnum - agent (see the FS::agent manpage)
    refnum - referral (see the FS::part_referral manpage)
    first - name
    last - name
    ss - social security number (optional)
    company - (optional)
    address1
    address2 - (optional)
    city
    county - (optional, see the FS::cust_main_county manpage)
    state - (see the FS::cust_main_county manpage)
    zip
    country - (see the FS::cust_main_county manpage)
    daytime - phone (optional)
    night - phone (optional)
    payby - `CARD' (credit cards), `BILL' (billing), or `COMP' (free)
    payinfo - card number, P.O.#, or comp issuer (4-8 lowercase alphanumerics; think username)
    paydate - expiration date, mm/yyyy, m/yyyy, mm/yy or m/yy
    payname - name on card or billing name
    tax - tax exempt, empty or `Y'
    otaker - order taker (assigned automatically, see the FS::UID manpage)
METHODS
    new HASHREF
        Creates a new customer. To add the customer to the database,
        see the section on "insert".

        Note that this stores the hash reference, not a distinct
        copy of the hash it points to. You can ask the object for a
        copy with the *hash* method.

    insert
        Adds this customer to the database. If there is an error,
        returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    delete
        Currently unimplemented. Maybe cancel all of this customer's
        packages (cust_pkg)?

        I don't remove the customer record in the database because
        there would then be no record the customer ever existed
        (which is bad, no?)

    replace OLD_RECORD
        Replaces the OLD_RECORD with this one in the database. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false.

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid customer
        record. If there is an error, returns the error, otherwise
        returns false. Called by the insert and repalce methods.

    all_pkgs
        Returns all packages (see the FS::cust_pkg manpage) for this
        customer.

    ncancelled_pkgs
        Returns all non-cancelled packages (see the FS::cust_pkg
        manpage) for this customer.

    bill OPTIONS
        Generates invoices (see the FS::cust_bill manpage) for this
        customer. Usually used in conjunction with the collect
        method.

        The only currently available option is `time', which bills
        the customer as if it were that time. It is specified as a
        UNIX timestamp; see the section on "time" in the perlfunc
        manpage). Also see the Time::Local manpage and the
        Date::Parse manpage for conversion functions.

        If there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false.

    collect OPTIONS
        (Attempt to) collect money for this customer's outstanding
        invoices (see the FS::cust_bill manpage). Usually used after
        the bill method.

        Depending on the value of `payby', this may print an invoice
        (`BILL'), charge a credit card (`CARD'), or just add any
        necessary (pseudo-)payment (`COMP').

        If there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false.

        Currently available options are:

        invoice_time - Use this time when deciding when to print
        invoices and late notices on those invoices. The default is
        now. It is specified as a UNIX timestamp; see the section on
        "time" in the perlfunc manpage). Also see the Time::Local
        manpage and the Date::Parse manpage for conversion
        functions.

        batch_card - Set this true to batch cards (see the
        cust_pay_batch manpage). By default, cards are processed
        immediately, which will generate an error if CyberCash is
        not installed.

        report_badcard - Set this true if you want bad card
        transactions to return an error. By default, they don't.

    total_owed
        Returns the total owed for this customer on all invoices
        (see the FS::cust_bill manpage).

    total_credited
        Returns the total credits (see the FS::cust_credit manpage)
        for this customer.

    balance
        Returns the balance for this customer (total owed minus
        total credited).

    invoicing_list [ ARRAYREF ]
        If an arguement is given, sets these email addresses as
        invoice recipients (see the FS::cust_main_invoice manpage).
        Errors are not fatal and are not reported (except as
        warnings), so use check_invoicing_list first.

        Returns a list of email addresses (with svcnum entries
        expanded).

        Note: You can clear the invoicing list by passing an empty
        ARRAYREF. You can check it without disturbing anything by
        passing nothing.

        This interface may change in the future.

    check_invoicing_list ARRAYREF
        Checks these arguements as valid input for the
        invoicing_list method. If there is an error, returns the
        error, otherwise returns false.

BUGS
    The delete method.

    Bill and collect options should probably be passed as references
    instead of a list.

    CyberCash v2 forces us to define some variables in package main.

    There should probably be a configuration file with a list of
    allowed credit card types.

    CyberCash is the only processor.

    No multiple currency support (probably a larger project than
    just this module).

    Changed to standard Business::CreditCard no more TableUtil
    EXPORT_OK FS::Record's hfields removed unique calls and locking
    (not needed here now) wrapped the (now) optional fields in if
    statements in sub check (notyetdone!) ivan@sisd.com 97-nov-12

    updated paydate with SQL-type date info ivan@sisd.com 98-mar-5

    Added export of datasrc from UID.pm for Pg6.3 changed 'day' to

    bmccane@maxbaud.net 98-apr-3

    in ->create, s/svc_acct/cust_main/, now it should actually

    don't require a phone number and allow '/' in company names
    ivan@sisd.com 98-jul-18

    use ut_ and rewrite &check, &*_pkgs ivan@sisd.com 98-sep-5

    pod, merge with FS::Bill (about time!), total_owed,
    total_credited and balance methods, cleaned collect method,
    source modifications no longer necessary to enable cybercash,
    cybercash v3 support, don't need to import

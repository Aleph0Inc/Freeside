NAME
    FS::SSH - Subroutines to call ssh and scp

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::SSH qw(ssh scp issh iscp sshopen2 sshopen3);

      ssh($host, $command);

      issh($host, $command);

      scp($source, $destination);

      iscp($source, $destination);

      sshopen2($host, $reader, $writer, $command);

      sshopen3($host, $reader, $writer, $error, $command);

DESCRIPTION
      Simple wrappers around ssh and scp commands.

SUBROUTINES
    ssh HOST, COMMAND
        Calls ssh in batch mode.

    issh HOST, COMMAND
        Prints the ssh command to be executed, waits for the user to
        confirm, and (optionally) executes the command.

    scp SOURCE, DESTINATION
        Calls scp in batch mode.

    iscp SOURCE, DESTINATION
        Prints the scp command to be executed, waits for the user to
        confirm, and (optionally) executes the command.

    sshopen2 HOST, READER, WRITER, COMMAND
        Connects the supplied filehandles to the ssh process (in
        batch mode).

    sshopen3 HOST, WRITER, READER, ERROR, COMMAND
        Connects the supplied filehandles to the ssh process (in
        batch mode).

BUGS
        Not OO.

        scp stuff should transparantly use rsync-over-ssh instead.

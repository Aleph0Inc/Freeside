NAME
    FS::part_svc - Object methods for part_svc objects

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::part_svc;

      $record = new FS::part_referral \%hash
      $record = new FS::part_referral { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::part_svc represents a service definition. FS::part_svc
    inherits from FS::Record. The following fields are currently
    supported:

    svcpart - primary key (assigned automatically for new service definitions)
    svc - text name of this service definition
    svcdb - table used for this service.  See the FS::svc_acct manpage,
    the FS::svc_domain manpage, and the FS::svc_acct_sm manpage, among others.
    *svcdb*__*field* - Default or fixed value for *field* in *svcdb*.
    *svcdb*__*field*_flag - defines *svcdb*__*field* action: null, `D' for default, or `F' for fixed
METHODS
    new HASHREF
        Creates a new service definition. To add the service
        definition to the database, see the section on "insert".

    insert
        Adds this service definition to the database. If there is an
        error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    delete
        Currently unimplemented.

    replace OLD_RECORD
        Replaces OLD_RECORD with this one in the database. If there
        is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid service
        definition. If there is an error, returns the error,
        otherwise returns false. Called by the insert and replace
        methods.

BUGS
    Delete is unimplemented.

    The list of svc_* tables is hardcoded. When svc_acct_pop is
    renamed, this should be fixed.

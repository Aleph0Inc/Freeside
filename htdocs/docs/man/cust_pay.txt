NAME
    FS::cust_pay - Object methods for cust_pay objects

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::cust_pay;

      $record = create FS::cust_pay \%hash;
      $record = create FS::cust_pay { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::cust_pay object represents a payment. FS::cust_pay
    inherits from FS::Record. The following fields are currently
    supported:

    paynum - primary key (assigned automatically for new payments)
    invnum - Invoice (see the FS::cust_bill manpage)
    paid - Amount of this payment
    _date - specified as a UNIX timestamp; see the section on "time" in the perlfunc manpage.  Also see
    the Time::Local manpage and the Date::Parse manpage for conversion functions.
    payby - `CARD' (credit cards), `BILL' (billing), or `COMP' (free)
    payinfo - card number, P.O.#, or comp issuer (4-8 lowercase alphanumerics; think username)
    paybatch - text field for tracking card processing
METHODS
    create HASHREF
        Creates a new payment. To add the payment to the databse,
        see the section on "insert".

    insert
        Adds this payment to the databse, and updates the invoice
        (see the FS::cust_bill manpage).

    delete
        Currently unimplemented (accounting reasons).

    replace OLD_RECORD
        Currently unimplemented (accounting reasons).

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid payment. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false. Called by the insert method.

BUGS
    It doesn't properly override FS::Record yet.

    Delete and replace methods.

NAME
    FS::cust_pay_batch - Object methods for batch cards

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::cust_pay_batch;

      $record = new FS::cust_pay_batch \%hash;
      $record = new FS::cust_pay_batch { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::cust_pay_batch object represents a credit card
    transaction ready to be batched (sent to a processor).
    FS::cust_pay_batch inherits from FS::Record. Typically called by
    the collect method of an FS::cust_main object. The following
    fields are currently supported:

    trancode - 77 for charges
    cardnum
    exp - card expiration
    amount
    invnum - invoice
    custnum - customer
    payname - name on card
    first - name
    last - name
    address1
    address2
    city
    state
    zip
    country
METHODS
    new HASHREF
        Creates a new record. To add the record to the database, see
        the section on "insert".

        Note that this stores the hash reference, not a distinct
        copy of the hash it points to. You can ask the object for a
        copy with the *hash* method.

    insert
        Adds this record to the database. If there is an error,
        returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    delete
        Delete this record from the database. If there is an error,
        returns the error, otherwise returns false.

    replace OLD_RECORD
        #inactive # #Replaces the OLD_RECORD with this one in the
        database. If there is an error, #returns the error,
        otherwise returns false.

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid transaction.
        If there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false. Called by the insert and repalce methods.

BUGS

    allowed credit card types.

NAME
    FS::svc_acct - Object methods for svc_acct records

SYNOPSIS
      use FS::svc_acct;

      $record = create FS::svc_acct \%hash;
      $record = create FS::svc_acct { 'column' => 'value' };

      $error = $record->insert;

      $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

      $error = $record->delete;

      $error = $record->check;

      $error = $record->suspend;

      $error = $record->unsuspend;

      $error = $record->cancel;

DESCRIPTION
    An FS::svc_acct object represents an account. FS::svc_acct
    inherits from FS::Record. The following fields are currently
    supported:

    svcnum - primary key (assigned automatcially for new accounts)
    username
    _password - generated if blank
    popnum - Point of presence (see the FS::svc_acct_pop manpage)
    uid
    gid
    finger - GECOS
    dir - set automatically if blank (and uid is not)
    shell
    quota - (unimplementd)
    slipip - IP address
    radius_*Radius_Attribute* - *Radius-Attribute*
METHODS
    create HASHREF
        Creates a new account. To add the account to the database,
        see the section on "insert".

    insert
        Adds this account to the database. If there is an error,
        returns the error, otherwise returns false.

        The additional fields pkgnum and svcpart (see the
        FS::cust_svc manpage) should be defined. An FS::cust_svc
        record will be created and inserted.

        If the configuration value (see the FS::Conf manpage)
        shellmachine exists, and the username, uid, and dir fields
        are defined, the command

          useradd -d $dir -m -s $shell -u $uid $username

        is executed on shellmachine via ssh. This behaviour can be
        surpressed by setting $FS::svc_acct::nossh_hack true.

    delete
        Deletes this account from the database. If there is an
        error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.

        The corresponding FS::cust_svc record will be deleted as
        well.

        If the configuration value (see the FS::Conf manpage)
        shellmachine exists, the command:

          userdel $username

        is executed on shellmachine via ssh. This behaviour can be
        surpressed by setting $FS::svc_acct::nossh_hack true.

    replace OLD_RECORD
        Replaces OLD_RECORD with this one in the database. If there
        is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.

        If the configuration value (see the FS::Conf manpage)
        shellmachine exists, and the dir field has changed, the
        command:

          [ -d $old_dir ] && (
            chmod u+t $old_dir;
            umask 022;
            mkdir $new_dir;
            cd $old_dir;
            find . -depth -print | cpio -pdm $new_dir;
            chmod u-t $new_dir;
            chown -R $uid.$gid $new_dir;
            rm -rf $old_dir
          )

        is executed on shellmachine via ssh. This behaviour can be
        surpressed by setting $FS::svc_acct::nossh_hack true.

    suspend
        Suspends this account by prefixing *SUSPENDED* to the
        password. If there is an error, returns the error, otherwise
        returns false.

        Called by the suspend method of FS::cust_pkg (see the
        FS::cust_pkg manpage).

    unsuspend
        Unsuspends this account by removing *SUSPENDED* from the
        password. If there is an error, returns the error, otherwise
        returns false.

        Called by the unsuspend method of FS::cust_pkg (see the
        FS::cust_pkg manpage).

    cancel
        Just returns false (no error) for now.

        Called by the cancel method of FS::cust_pkg (see the
        FS::cust_pkg manpage).

    check
        Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid service. If
        there is an error, returns the error, otherwise returns
        false. Called by the insert and replace methods.

        Sets any fixed values; see the FS::part_svc manpage.

BUGS
    It doesn't properly override FS::Record yet.

    The remote commands should be configurable.

    The create method should set defaults from part_svc (like the
    check method sets fixed values).

web stuff going to /var/www/freeside/masondocs oops

apache configs going to
./etc/freeside/apache2/freeside-rt.conf
??  oh there's links etc.  check

file
./and..?/
in freeside-lib?  oops wtf
also
./default_conf/
and
/#for/

test actually installing!
- FS files
- /var/www/ files
- what else should package install?
  - init script
  - apache config
  - /usr/local/etc/freeside/default_conf for new installs

test RT was missing, but we're cheating more now by ignoring a huge remap
to deb policy-comliant paths.  get it working

init.d/freeside-init
htetc/handler.pl

#copied to /usr/local/etc/freeside by make install-docs
htetc/htpasswd.logout

init.d/insserv-override-apache2

etc/longtable.sty

--- Medium --- 

test) freeside-webui /etc/apache/conf.d/freeside.conf
  AuthUserFile is wrong (just fucked)

test in postinst) freeside package var/cache/freeside/cache.<datasrc is missing>

bin/* ?  Anything here needed in a live customer install should be moved to FS/bin so it installs as part of the packaging.

freeside-selfservice-client doesn't install at all

--- Debian ---

redo & test its working) somes sort of Alias /freeside /usr/share/freeside/www is needed
/var/www/freeside -> /usr/lib/freeside and Alias in apache

Added to README.Debian... do something else?
Ensure apache is set to run as User freeside.

init script doesn't need to add /usr/local/bin.  could start over from 
init.d.ex or init.d.lsb.ex

finish 

RT install locations (?  maybe our RT libraries shouldn't conflict with
upstream ones?)

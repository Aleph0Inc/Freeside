	Hi,
	
	   I found an problem in Interface/Email.pm when I was modifying
	   enhanced mailgate. I have attached a diff of the modifications.
	
	   In the function MailError, it assumes MIMIEOBJ is defined. I added a
	   simple "if" test to only run $MIMEOBJ->sync_headers if $MIMEOBJ is defined.

		First up, ivan switched lib/RT over to using MakeMaker..so now
		we get man pages for the core modules and a bunch of other cool stuff.
	
		Second: ivan handed us an almost complete keywords system.  Over the next
		week or two, I'm going to be adding ACL support to the keywords system
		and starting to integrate bits of it better into the rest of the core
		(though it's nearly all done already).

	The linking interface now uses URIs internally. and it does lots of
	sanity checking.
	
	Tickets now understand what their uris should be. you can load tickets by

2000-10-15 01:57  jesse

	VS: ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	
2000-10-15 01:11  jesse

	Significantly redid the installation procedure. we're now _much_

2000-10-15 01:08  jesse

	* etc/: config.pm, suidrt.c:

	* bin/rtmux.pl, bin/webmux.pl, etc/schema.pm,

	CurrentUser.pm had LoadByEmail and LoadByUserId methods added and they're now
	actually used most everywhere.
	
	insertdata doesn't force ids for users now.
	
	the schema now actually enforces a lot of important uniqueness constraints.

	Makefile now assumes www-data instead of nobody as the web user. this is not quite right.

	instead of easily letting referential integrity checks just _fail_.
	
	Insertdata got cleaned up a little bit.
	
	ACL got its cleaned up a bit

	* etc/schema.pm, tools/initdb:

	a debugging hook in initdb and defaults (though they don't work just right yet)

	tools/insertdata:

	Fairly massive installation changes.
		We now use ivan's really cool DBIx::DBschema, which, when things
	settle out a bit mean that the oracle and postgres (and possibly other) ports
	get their schema updated automatically.
	
	The initial seed data is now inserted by tools/insertdata through the RT API.
	
	ACE::Create now actually works.
	Same with Scrip::Create.
	and Queue::Create.
	
	There are a couple of new installation-only dependencies. One of them (DBSchema) may become a build-only
	dependency if people whine enough :)
	
	date/time handling was a casualty of the changes. some things will be handled oddly for now.
	Once Ivan releases the next DBSchema update, this should get better again. it was
	the result of a namespace collision between pg and mysql. the timestamp column has
	different behavior. go fig.
	
	This version will require DBIx::SearchBuilder 0.06 (aka what I'm about to check in)

	* README:

	Clarified license terms. RT is available under Version 2 of the GPL.

	* etc/schema.Oracle, etc/schema.mysql, lib/RT/ACE.pm,
	lib/RT/ACL.pm, lib/RT/Scrip.pm, lib/RT/User.pm:

	Ugh. Mysql isn't respecting SQL92 reserved words. which meant that I didn't
	notice that I was using "Type" and "Action" in my schema.
	This required a bit of churn to the ACE and User modules.

	Yanked the ancient lib/RT/Database.pm. It  never served any purpose
	added some functionality to RT::Date. it can now take a date type
	of 'unknown.'  This will "require" Date::Manip and parse it into
	an ISO style date.  note that this should NEVER be called from RT's
	core due to overhead. It is useful from web interfaces and CLI tools....
	
	added date::manip as a requirement to webmux.pl (so it gets loaded before
	client hits)
	
	cleaned up Interface/Web.pm
	
	rationalized some of the routines dealing with date stuff in ticket.pm.
	
	Actual working web date changing should be coming "soon." (where soon is
	defined as sometime this week)

	API Change. Queue is NO LONGER the Queue Object for a ticket
	API Change. Owner is NO LONGER the Owner Object for a ticket
	
	instead, both point to their proper database values and OwnerObj and QueueObj
	do the right thing throughout. This was rather more code churn than I was hoping for, but we've now got a cleaner, more consistent API that's easier to work
	with.
	
	little bits of POD update.
	
	Cleaned out some unused code.
	
	Made some error messages more professional.
	
	We now keep track of date started as well as a "start by" date.  these both
	need a bit more work.
	
	Calling convention for _Set changed. Rather than three different calling
	conventions which weren't very extensible, DBIx::Record::_Set and all its
	subclasses now use paramhash style calling. it's much more extensible and
	flexible now. (This was necessary for some ACL work, among other things)

	Weekend of 1 Aug 2000
	---------------------
	I spent the weekend in DC visiting family.   This meant I got a bit of
	code written ;)  Sadly, I have no access to the CVS server,
	so I'll be batching a bunch of commits.
	
	1. Enabled CLI admin tool
	2. Added ACL listing functionality to the CLI admin tool.
	3. Enhanced RT::Queue->Grant such that it works with the structure of RT2
	   ACLs
	4. Made the Logging framework actually log errors to STDERR.
	   (This makes debugging the CLI tools much easier. It also means
	    that the cli tools explain _why_ they're dying.)
	5. Fully expunged use of Mysql's SQL keyword "now()". I'd have left this
	   stuff in, except mysql doesn't seem to deal well with the idea that the
	   entire world isn't one timezone.  On top of that, it doesn't seem to
	   have a way to force it into GMT mode that doesn't involve modifying init
	   scripts. *sigh*
	6. Did a whole bunch more work on the ACL checking in RT::User
	7. Wrote up some preliminary docs on local hacks to RT
	8. Added in a routine to allow local canonicalization of email addresses
	9. Added in the concept of "Disabled users"  To preserve RT2's database
	   Integrity, whacking user accounts would be a bad thing. So, instead,
	   we've got the concept of 'disabled' users. A disabled user fails ANY
	   ACL check, ANY password check and doesn't appear in any lists of ACLs.
	   (note that the lastmost statement isn't yet true)
	
	10. rtadmin user -enable and rtadmin user -disable now work.
	11. ACLs are now enforced for many ticket related actions.
	    (this does mean that you'll want to insert some acls like those below)
	
	INSERT INTO ACL VALUES (1,0,'User','SuperUser','Queue',0);
	INSERT INTO ACL VALUES (2,3,'User','CreateTicket','Queue',0);
	INSERT INTO ACL VALUES (3,3,'User','ShowTicket','Ticket',0);
	INSERT INTO ACL VALUES (4,3,'User','ShowTicketHistory','Ticket',0);
	INSERT INTO ACL VALUES (6,3,'User','CreateTicket','Queue',1);
	INSERT INTO ACL VALUES (7,3,'User','ModifyTicket','Ticket',1);
	INSERT INTO ACL VALUES (8,1,'User','Superuser','System',0);
	INSERT INTO ACL VALUES (9,0,'Everyone','Superuser','System',0);
	
2000-08-02 00:17  jesse

	* bin/: rtmux.pl, testdeps.pl:

	Bumped us up to requiring Log::Dispatch 1.6.
	Cleaned up testdeps a bit. Now, you knwo it passes.

	made html escaping on included entities on webrt default.

	* lib/RT/Date.pm:

2000-07-27 02:01  jesse

	* README, lib/RT/Date.pm, lib/RT/Record.pm, lib/RT/Ticket.pm,
	bin/testdeps.pl:

	Moved Date managment routines from DBIx::Record to RT::Record.
	Initial Checkin of RT::Date, a lightweight Date object capable
	of doing everything RT needs. Oh. and it's fully documented in POD.
	
	Converted RT::Record and RT::Ticket and the cli to use RT::Date instead
	of Date::Kronos.  The CLI now feels _much_ zippier and code within
	RT::Ticket is a bit easier to read.

	  some sort of a hack as it discards charset information in the header.
	  Anyway, in those cases where the header data will be in the same charset
	  as the body, this works out nicely.
	- I'm allowing a user to see what data is stored at him.  We might need ACLs
	  for the user comment.  Also, this one is placed directly on the root, so
	  it will break if the user is not logged in.  Also, the page and the module
	  is 'ViewUser', 'ShowUser' would be more consistent.
	- Prettified the ShowTransaction header

	Uh, some weird debugging stuff came into the last commit - I should
	have checked better.
	
	Some of those autohandlers seems like copies of each other.  There
	must be better ways to do this (i.e. separating all the common stuff
	into some module)?

	Response is the default action.  I've added a cryptical line which

	I've started looking at the mail interface.  Now linking works through the mailgate, though we need some info in the docs.  I'm proposing that it should accept both commands in the headerlines ("RT-Command: Link/Resolve/Whatever blahblah") and traditional commands in the mail ("%RT Link", "%RT Resolve", etc), though I've only supported the first one yet.  Look at the comments in Email.pm for details.

	* lib/RT/Ticket.pm:

	Removed VerboseSubject and HTMLSubject
	
2000-05-22 17:24  tobiasb

	* lib/RT/Ticket.pm:

	I do use $Ticket->Subject (and other stuff as well) frequently when
	I'm editing Mason.  There is two issues;
	
	1) Things might look freaked if the ticket has no subject, i.e. Display.html
	
	2) Things might get totally whacko if the subject contains HTML code.
	
	I could ensure the "right" behaviour all the places by using
	HTML::Entities::encode (I've done it one place), and by always using
	$Subject||"(No subject)".  Anyway, I think it might be more
	appropriate to have a sub RT::Ticket::VerboseSubject and
	RT::Ticket::HTMLSubject.
	
	What do you think?
	
2000-05-22 16:51  tobiasb

	* webrt/Ticket/Display.html:

	Removed a debug (?) line that was commented out:

	- logs an info message with ticket id, subject and queue upon

	I will also make a sub RT::Links::URI2HTML which gives smart links to

	Right, we need to work a bit with the links API.
	
	- we need an AllLinks sub.  How to tell EasySearch to give both links
	where we're BASE and were we're TARGET?
	
	- we need an "unresolved dependencies" according to the current
	design.  How to tell if a dependency is unresolved?  Dependencies can
	point out of this RT instance!
	
	- we might need more subs, but not right now anyway.
	
2000-05-12 11:32  tobiasb

	* webrt/Ticket/Elements/ShowTransaction:

	partly a bugfix; 'QouteTransaction=attachment-id' doesn't work very well for transactions without attachment.  Maybe that link should only be for attachments, and not for transactions.  Anyway, I changed it to transaction-id instead.  And I also added 'spawn' to the title; I think 'spawning' should be done through the same page.  'spawn' is when creating a new request that is linked up somehow to the old one.  Maybe it rather should be titled 'forward' or 'create new' or something?

		To get it up running even without mod_perl, you will need to

	Fixing up the loop control.  When a possible loop occurs, an error
	flag is set, and a new header field RT-Loop-Alarm appears.  I feel a
	bit bad about the latter, we are indeed changing an email after it
	arrived to the system, which I think is a bad thing - but anyway not
	as bad as dropping the email completely.  My idea is that the Actions,
	particularly the SendEmail.pm Action remain silent when this header
	field is set.

2000-05-05 10:01  tobiasb

	* etc/config.pm:

	Added Log::Dispatch.  I also have added those comments, which I would
	like comments on (:
	
	# Most (if not all?) $RT:: global variables should be here.  I'd

	I'm not sure if "use strict" breaks, but at least "use vars" breaks
	bigtime as we are using it other places (like rtmux.pl).  I suggest
	using another package name for the execution logic.  What do you
	think?
	
2000-05-05 08:07  tobiasb

	* lib/RT/: Action.pm, Scrip.pm, ScripScope.pm, Template.pm,
	Ticket.pm, Transaction.pm, Action/AutoReply.pm,
	Action/SendEmail.pm, Action/Spam.pm:

	Cleaned up a couple minor things (like precedence, again) and changed "FixSubject" to "SetSubjectTag"
	
	Fixed the memory leak in Transaction.pm (it wasn't letting go of Scrip objects)
	The fix was a bit of a "large mallet on a small nail" in that I'm now _explicitly_ destroying ScripObjects two different ways and don't quite understand why I have to do it. It does, however, work.

	Sorry, the last commit on this file was not really a bugfix.  I'd say all Ticket (Transaction) Actions should return status, message and eventually optional things after the message.

	Doing work on cookie-based authentication for WebRT. The basic idea
	is that the autohandler in each directory (unless the global handlers can be made to work) will check to see if the user is authenticated. If they are, then it keeps going happily. otherwise, it forces the user to login with the form in /Login.html, which should eventually be smart enough to put them back to where they want to go.

	I realize this is probably not what you were asking for, but I'd like to
	mention here my recent (yesterday) experience in setting up Mason under
	plain ol' CGI.
	
	Setting: One Mason top level component plus a few subcomponents on a
	development server with mod_perl and Mason. One production server with the
	least possible selection of modules. (Not even mod_so!)
	
	Needed to quickly get the Mason component up and running on the second
	server. Installing Mason itself and a few other perl modules was easy.
	But adding mod_perl was definitely out of the question.
	
	What I did was take the usual handler.pl, copy it to cgi-bin, deleting
	everything from "my $ah = new HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler" onward
	inclusive, and replacing it with the following:
	
	    use CGI;
	    my $q = new CGI;
	
	    # This routine comes from ApacheHandler.pm:
	    my (%args);
	    foreach my $key ( $q->param ) {
	      foreach my $value ( $q->param($key) ) {
	        if (exists($args{$key})) {
	          if (ref($args{$key})) {
	            $args{$key} = [@{$args{$key}}, $value];
	          } else {
	            $args{$key} = [$args{$key}, $value];
	          }
	        } else {
	          $args{$key} = $value;
	        }
	    }
	
	    my $comp = $ENV{'PATH_TRANSLATED'};
	    my $root = $interp->comp_root;
	    $comp ~= s/^$root//  or die "Component outside comp_root";
	
	    $interp->exec($comp, %args);
	
	This, plus an Action line in httpd.conf mapping *.mas to this script, has
	so far done the job just fine.
	
	One problem I noticed was that this all would've been much harder if I
	hadn't been familiar with the way ApacheHandler.pm uses CGI.pm and hadn't
	known where to find that parsing routine. IMHO it'd be a good idea to
	separate this loop into a user-callable subroutine.
	
	(Note: this was Mason 0.6.mumble - I have no experience with the newer
	versions.)

	right, so now, it just creates a MIME::Entity when it needs it, which is
	probably better anyway.  I simplified templates a bit. Now they only have
	access to the Ticket and Transaction. This may not be wise, but we'll see.
	
	Also, I merged the two blobs per template (headers and body).

	* lib/RT/Action/SendEmail.pm:

	The recipients aren't set anywhere as far as I can see ... and I'm really uncertain what you've thought of with SetEnvelopeTo vs SetTo, etc.  You'd better take a look.  Obviously, this won't work until the recipients are set somehow

	I've mostly only added comments.  Anyway, I must say that I like this

	lib/RT/Action/SendEmail.pm:

	Lots of works on Scrip, ScripScope, Action. Tobias: wanna take a look?
	Basically, now Templates are autoloaded by RT::Scrip.pm and passed into
	the Action as TemplateObj.  Also, Templates are now of type MIME::Entity,
	which means that they have all the attributes of mail messages and can
	just be sent.

2000-03-27 15:36  tobiasb

	* docs/design_docs/subscription-definitions.txt:

	How does the system determinate whom to send mail to?
	
	The ScripScope table in the DB should indicate whether a Scrip is relevant
	for a queue or not /* TobiX thinks that this might eventually be extended to
	keywords, tickets, etc, and not only Queues */ ... the Scope table should
	indicate whether the Scrip is relevant for a given transaction type ... then
	the given Action should determinate whether it applies or not, and finally
	the Action has to find out (via the Watchers table) whom it applies to, and
	how to contact them ... and the Template tells how the mails that are sent
	out should look like.

	Work on NotifyOnResolve (Formerly NotifyWatchersOnResolve)
	
	They don't _work_ per se. But they're getting closer. I'm wondering
	whether we want to do something smarter with all the addresses we're passing
	in to make it easier to remove specific ones...for example, we currently
	have no way to _not_ send mail to the reuqestor.

	* lib/RT/Action/: AutoReply.pm, SendEmail.pm:

2000-03-25 01:03  jesse

	* Makefile, lib/RT/Template.pm, lib/RT/Ticket.pm,
	lib/RT/Action/SendEmail.pm:

	Work on the templating system. I actually gutted Template.pm and SendEmail.pm
	(sorry tobix :/)  Basically RT::Template is now A MIME::Entity object, which
	means that the various things one can do to mail messages can now be done to
	RT::Template objects, once you run $TemplateObj->Parse on them..
	SendEmail was cleaned up somewhat to be less intimidating to people who aren't
	as comfortable with big chunks of fairly dense perl.  Oh and it's a heck of a
	lot more subclassable now ;)
	
	Fixed a tiny bug in Ticket.pm resulting from the changes to Watchers.

	This is a suggestion about a simple splitting of the Scrips table.  I
	think the admin tools will be significantly easier to set up if we do

	Scrips from a queue.

	This may look like a lot of code. but it's not.
	It's merely the result of running
	
	perl -pi.bak -e 's/sub (.*?){\n/# {{{ sub $1\nsub $1 {\n/; s/^}$/}\n# }}}/'
	
	basically, this adds # {{{ sub function
		         and # }}}
	around all the function names. The main reason to do this is for
	emacs fold-minor-mode.  It makes things a lot easier to read.
	In an ideal world, we'd have perl-aware folding editor and there'd be
	no need for this markup

	Modified the schema for my "New Improved Watchers" system. Basically,
	now you'll be able to tie a template to a given watch. along with a
	boolean "send mail" flag.  We'll need a special "Mail Watchers" action to
	make this all work..but the code should be pretty easy.

2000-02-29 10:12  tobiasb

	* etc/schema.mysql:

	Added ExtraHeaders as VARCHAR(255).  255 characters should be enough
	for storing some few extra header lines, but anyway maybe it should
	have been blob instead?
	
2000-02-29 09:51  tobiasb

	* lib/RT/: Attachment.pm, Action/AutoReply.pm, Action/SendEmail.pm:

	I've continued the work on mail sending.  There is still some missing
	stuff:
	
	1. EasySearch/Scrips issue - currently it doesn't properly output "
	all scrips that has (queue=0 or queue=this) and (type="any" or type=this)".
	
	2. A serious stub in RT::Action::SendEmail - I don't know where to find
	"interessted parties".  I think it could be nice putting queue watchers
	in the same table as ticket watchers.
	
2000-02-29 09:42  tobiasb

	* lib/RT/Scrips.pm:

	Hack - everything that applies for a Correspondence action also
	applies for a Create action (I'd daresay).
	
2000-02-29 07:02  tobiasb

	* lib/RT/Transaction.pm:

	Some insignificant changes.  Well, one marginally significant; it
	shouldn't $Scrip->Commit unless $Scrip->Prepare()
	
2000-02-29 04:12  tobiasb

	* etc/schema.mysql:

	I've started at general transaction emails.
	
2000-02-29 03:58  tobiasb

	* lib/RT/Watchers.pm:

	Added an Emails method.  It can be used like:
	
	   print join(",", @{$Watchers->Emails("Requestors")});
	
	or
	
	   $Watchers->LimitToRequestors;
	   $Emails=$Watchers->Emails;

2000-02-28 11:33  tobiasb

	* lib/RT/: Template.pm, Transaction.pm, Action/AutoReply.pm,
	Action/SendEmail.pm:

	AutoReply seems to work now ... except that rtadmin didn't set email
	aliases for the queue, so the mail bounces with invalid from address.
	I won't look more at this until tomorrow.  You're very welcome to take
	over for a while if you feel like it :)

2000-02-28 05:25  tobiasb

	* lib/RT/: Ticket.pm, Transaction.pm, Action/AutoReply.pm,
	Action/SendEmail.pm:

	- The queue tag rather than queue id is delievered from the cli, this
	  broke in Ticket::Create.  Fixed.
	
	- The Attachments have to be assigned to a transaction before Scrips
	   is run.  Now the Attachments are delievered as a part of the parameters
	   to Transaction::Create
	
2000-02-27 23:28  tobiasb

	* etc/schema.mysql:

	Fixed the AutoReply template ... still not tested, though.
	
2000-02-27 22:04  tobiasb

	* lib/RT/Action/: AutoReply.pm, SendEmail.pm:

	I think we can nuke the old rt/lib/rt/support/mail.pm now - everything
	should be located in SendEmail.pm, AutoReply.pm and Template.pm by now :)
	
	It's not tested yet, and the templates needs upgrading.  Anyway, I will
	probably not mess more around with the perl code as for now.

	30 Sep 1999
	-----------
	
	*  Fixed a bug which caused RT to go crazy when comments were submitted
	   by may without a ticket #.
	
	The following changes are from johnl@microware.com
	
	   1. Directories were not getting created with the correct modes under            /usr/local/rt/transactions.                                                         The umask() takes an octal file mode mask, not a file mode.                                                                                                     In addition I read the comments about $dirmode not working when             doing the mkdir's in content.pm.  I also fixed content.pm to use                $dirmode.  The main problem was the $dirmode was being set to a string          instead of an octal number.
	
	  Fixes to database.pm
	    1.  The first hunk fixes problem where the call to write_content is             passing $time.  This variable does not exist.   It looked like $time was        supposed to be the current time.  ($time always == 0).  I changed all           occurances of $time to time (IE: time()).                                                                                                                       2.  The first hunk also passes $in_time instead of $time.                                                                                                       3.  The rest of the hunks fix $time and replace them with time().

	-----------------
	Inital cleanup to the web ticket view. I'd like to significantly
	compact and simplify that display.  More tables are probably in
	order.  Additionally, I want to get rid of all those buttons "I
	changed this." There's just no need for them. we can write logic
	to do that for us.  Also, I bumped the version to 1.1.1.  I'd like
	to do this 'linux-kernel-esque' The 1.1.x
	series will be a development series leading toward 1.2.  Once we
	get the DB changes in, I'll feel comfortable rolling a 'releaseable'
	1.1 version for people who like pain.

	--------
	Now, if you move a request to a new queue, it won't disown it if the same person can own reqs in the new queue. [fsck #75] (untested)
	
	Fixed a problem with cli create not properly handling due dates ([fsck #67])
	Fixed a duplicate --help entry for bin/rt [fsck #69]
	Fixed bugs fsck  #68/77: Odness Merging RT requests
	
	Transactions from merged requests will now be displayed along with the request id of the request that transaction was originially associated with.
	
	Fixed [fsck #74], which was reported by charlie brady:
	   Messages are sent out from the mail interface with content first, then
	   "--- Headers Follow ---", then the headers. In our vanilla sendmail setup,
	   before the headers is a UUCP style deliver notification "From blah Tue Jul
	   6 18:13:01 1999" line. This is interpreted by many mail agents as a
	   message delimiter, so that what is seen in the mail agent is not one, but
	   two messages. This is easily fixed by using the conventional quoting
	   mechanism...
	Fixed [fsck #71] WebRT: "User" should be "Requestor"

	All the following changes are from tobix:
	
		Correspondence from RT now properly reflect the name of the sender
		in the "from" header.
	
		Automated messages now properly have a "Precedence: bulk" header
	
		A stupid error with rt::mail_alias has been fixed
	
		Tobix' patch removes headers from all correspondence.  I'm relatively
		afraid of this change, so I'm going to comment it out for now.
	
		rtadmin (the commandline has a new tool) :
		     -update <passwd> <admin> [<users>]  updates user(s) from the
	                   /etc/passwd file. If no users are specified, ALL
	                   of /etc/passwd will be processed.

	        -- Dave Walton
	
	Ok.. I know this is being picky, but, in rt/lib/ui/web/support.pm, the
	subroutine "content_header", at line 290, should have:
	    print "<head><title>WebRT</title></head>\n";
	
	Otherwise, when running in frames, you never get a title on the page. :(
	
	No biggie...
	
	-Rich
	
	Oh, one other.
	
	8.  etc/mysql.acl, line 5
	The RT_MYSQL_HOST entry on that line doesn't make any sense
	when MySQL is on a different host than RT.  That should be
	RT_HOST, or some such thing.
	
	Dave
	
	After just upgrading to Apache 1.3.0 from 1.2.5, I figured I would make it
	known that, in the file <apache_src_dir>/src/main/util_script.c, you have
	to define SECURITY_HOLE_PASS_AUTHORIZATION to allow for RT's authorization
	to work properly.

	In mail.pm, there's a space before :
	
	From: $rt::mail_alias
	
	This causes problems in some mail clients, putting the From: line on the
	same line as the subject.  If the spaces are removed this is fixed.

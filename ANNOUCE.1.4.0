Price plans.  For starters, multi-level customer-to-customer commissions
in addition to flat rate pricing.  Price plans are written in Perl and
it's straightforward to add new ones.  I'm expect we'll see plans for
pro-rating, metered billing and the like soon.

New UI for packages and price plans.

Per-package tax exemption for setup and/or recurring fee         

New UI in the signup server, new customer and new account pages that 
breaks down access numbers by state and should be easier to use for a
large number of dialup numbers.  (POPs)   

Database support for local call mappin - the data on what exchanges
can call which of your access numbers as a local call.

easier installation/instructions & web configuration

expedited payment-entry
- a quick check entry tool for entering large numbers of checks as well
  as customer information on the payment entry screen

- automatic application of payments and credits to outstanding invoices
  
#freeside-overdue
#- the `freeside-overdue' script to list, add postal invoicing, suspend,   
#  or cancel overdue and/or expired accounts.

- Payments and credits are applied against invoices when posted.

- A bunch of UI fixes/tweaks: package browse, payment/credit entry, search
  by check #, others

  - Web interface for per-hour or per-minute account charges using the
    session monitor.
  
  - Invoice events - set late fees, suspension, cancellation, etc. events
    on overdue invoices.
  
  - Packages and service disable flags for a more manageable UI.

HTML manpages now up-to-date and generated on install

schema changes for more configurable export

no mysql support :(

invoice events work & show up on invoice view

- Pro-rating price plan

- svc_www for virtual host services
-svc_www is here, better support for apache integration

LinkPoint support

Most notably, the main menu has gotten a significant facelift and should
be easier to understand and use.

New frequently-requested financial reports contributed by Jeff Finucane,
thanks!

The queue daemon web UI has been finished - you can now retry and remove
jobs, error messages from failed jobs appear on the web interface, and
account detail pages show any pending provisioning jobs for thsoe
accounts.

fs-setup should work under MySQL again.  The browse links are still broken
("all customers", "all packages", "all accounts") but at least you should
be able to get everything else working...

Critical Path provisioning has been updated and can now username changes
and suspension/unsuspension.

  - now case-insensative
  - pulldown for search type

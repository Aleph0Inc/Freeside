      Two mandatory parameters define the collector schedule.
      The collector runs at moments defined by formula:
        time + period - (time mod period) + timeoffset

      Each period requires RRAs to be defined for that period
      RRAs use the following syntax   RRA:CF:xff:steps:rows
      as the calculation of setps and rows is period dependent

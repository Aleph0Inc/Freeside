=head1 NAME

rrddir2xml - Searches a directory for RRD files and generates Torrus XML
configuration file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<torrus rrddir2xml> --dir=I<DIR> [I<options...>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<rrddir2xml> searches in a given directory for RRD files and
creates Torrus XML configuration file suitable for browsing ofthose data
files.

With default options, it is usable for RRD files generated by Torrus'
SNMP collector, where the file name starts with the host name, separated by
underscore from interface name or other MIB specifics. With these
defaults, it creates a subtree per each host name, and all RRD files belonging
top that host name are sorted alphabetically in that subtree.

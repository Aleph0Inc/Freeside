=head1 NAME

action_snmptrap, action_snmpv1trap - Scripts for sending 
SNMP traps (version 2c and 1 respectively) from monitor action. 
C<action_snmpv1trap> is obsolete as the preferred SNMP version is 2c.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 <action name="snmptrap">
   <param name="action-type" value="exec" />
   <param name="command" value="$TORRUS_BIN/action_snmptrap" />
   <param name="launch-when" value="set, clear" />
 </action>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is designed for usage from a monitor action only. It takes
the arguments from environment variables, as described in action-type
C<exec> in B<Torrus XML Configuration Guide>. In addition, some values
may be supplied via command-line arguments (see section OPTIONS below).

Site-specific variables must be specified in the file
F<snmptrap-siteconfig.pl>. Default values are installed by the first run
of C<make install>. Subsequent 
runs of C<make install> do not override this file.

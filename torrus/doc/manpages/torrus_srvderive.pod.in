When the Torrus Reporting engine is set up, this command is used
to combine several services data into a new service ID. The output data
is either the maximum or the sum of input services.

=item B<--start>=I<YYYY-MM-DD>

Sets the start date of the calculation.

=item B<--end>=I<YYYY-MM-DD>

Sets the next day after the eond of the period.

=item B<--month>

Instead of setting the end data, it is convenient to use this option. It sets
the end data in one calendar month after the start date.

=head1 OUTPUT

=over 4

=item B<--out>=I<SERVICEID>

Sets the output service ID. This should not be a service ID used in the

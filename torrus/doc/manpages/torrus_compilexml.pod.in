=head1 NAME

compilexml - Torrus XML configuration (re)compiler.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<torrus compilexml> --tree=I<TREENAME> [I<options...>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command compiles the Torrus's XML configuration for the tree
I<TREENAME>. It does not require any other processes to be restarted
after the configuration is changed. Renderer's cache is automatically
flushed on on the next Renderer's run. Monitor automatically resets on
the next monitoring cycle. All dynamic tokensets in the given tree are
emptied.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--all>

Instructs to compile configuration for all trees.

=item B<--nods>

Instructs to compile non-datasource configuration only.

=item B<--noval>

Disables all validation of the XML configuration. This speeds up the
compilation up to 2 times, while adding a risk to end up with an
unusable configuration. In addition, the first initialization cycle of
Collector and Monitor in this case would be much longer.

=item B<--force>

Normally the compiler would fail to start if another compiler process
is already running for the specific tree. In case of abnormal function,
the running status of the previous pcompiler may stay in the database.
This option forces the compiler to continue even if if sees the presence
of another process.

=item B<--debug>

Sets the log level to debug.

=item B<--verbose>

Sets the debug level to info.

=item B<--help>

Displays a help message.

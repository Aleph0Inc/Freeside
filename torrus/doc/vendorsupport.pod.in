=head1 Torrus Vendor Support List

=head2 Introduction

This document provides a listing of vendor devices and generic MIBs
that are suppported by Torrus'es SNMP discovery utilities and/or templates
and other supporting files.

All SNMP MIBs described below are supported through C<devdiscover>,
the SNMP discovery utility. Where possible, the system contact, location,
and interface descriptions are copied to the generated Torrus configuration.


=head2 Generic SNMP MIBs

=over 4

=item * RFC1628 (UPS-MIB)

Generic statistics covered by most UPS manufactures, including input, output,
and bypass group information.

=item * RFC1697 (RDBMS-MIB)

Provides the database engine performance statistics. Tested with Oracle only.

=item * RFC2662 (ADSL-LINE-MIB)

ADSL DSLAM statitics and line status. Tested with Paradyne DSLAM.

=item * RFC2670 (DOCS-IF-MIB)

DOCSIS cable status and statistics. Tested with Cisco uBR.

=item * RFC2737 (ENTITY-MIB)

Used to retrieve information about chassis and temperature sensors in Cisco
devices.

=item * RFC2790 (HOST-RESOURCES-MIB)

Server CPU, memory, and disk statistics. Tested with net-snmp and MS Windows.

=item * RFC2863 (IF-MIB)

Generic network interface statistics from C<ifTable> and C<ifXTable>.
Most servers and network devices support this MIB. Featuring custom
vendor-dependent indexing and interface type/name filtering.
Tested with many different vendors.

=head2 Vendor-specific SNMP monitoring

=over 

=item * Alteon content switches

Application switching and performance statistics.

=item * Allied Telesyn PBC18 Media converter

Reports the line status for the manageable modular media converter.

=item * Arbor Networks

Provide statistics for Arbor eSeries devices. (e30, e100)

=item * Ascend MAX

Provides statistics for analog and ISDN interfaces, and the total number
of lines used.

=item * Atmel wireless access points and bridges

Privides link quality and traffic statistics for wireless devices.
The discovery process would run very slow unless you specify the
following parameter in the discovery instructions XML:

 <param name="only-devtypes" value="ATMEL"/>

=item * AxxessIT Ethernet over SDH switches (aka Cisco ONS 15300)

The module arranges the Ethernet interface statistics with
such information as slot/port mapping and interface descriptions.

=item * BetterNetworks EthernetBox

The discovery module detects active sensors in an EthernetBox sensor module.

=item * Brocade (Foundry)

A variety of Foundry switches and routers is supported for memory,
CPU, and temperature statistics.

=item * CASA Systems CMTS

Modem quantities per upstream, downstream, MAC domain.

=item * Cisco CatOS

Memory, CPU, and temperature information. Per-interface statistics may be
limited to the ports with description only.

=item * Cisco IOS

Provides per-interface traffic statistics; CPU, memory, and
temperature information; I/O buffer statistics; IPSec traffic information;
SAA agents statistics; cbQoS monitoring (implemented in a separate plugin);
DOCSIS uBR-specific variables (modem quantities and channel utilization);
CISCO-ENHANCED-MEMPOOL-MIB (linecards and VIP modules memory, see notes below);
MAC accounting statistics (associated with BGP AS numbers when applicable); LRE
and VDSL line statistics; BGP prefix counts (http://tinyurl.com/y3ganv);
CAR statistics; VPDN Statistics.


B<Note:> On Cisco 7500, IOS version 12.0(26)S2 or 12.0(26)S3,
CISCO-ENHANCED-MEMPOOL-MIB polling causes memory leak and leads to the router
crash (Bug ID CSCef53395). The problem is fixed in IOS versions
12.0(26)S5, 12.0(27)S3, 12.0(28)S2, and 12.0(30)S.


=item * Cisco PIX Firewall

Firewall performance statistics.

=item * Cisco SCE

Service Control Engine performance statistics.

=item * Compaq Insite Manager

Temperature and memory health information statistics for Compaq servers.

=item * Empire (Concord) SystemEDGE

Provides lots of statistics and information that a SystemEDGE agent
may provide about the server health and performance.

=item * F5 BigIp Load Balancer

In-detail traffic statistics.

=item * Force10 Networks

CPU, Temperature and Power supply statistics.

=item * Jacarta iMeter

Humidity, Temperature, Electric current meters.

=item * Juniper JunOS

Class of service, firewall, operating environment, reverse path forwarding,
and interface statistics.

=item * Liebert HVAC systems

Temperature, humidity and system state sensors

=item * Microsoft Windows 2000/XP

Sets up proper interface indexing and provides FTP and HTTP server statistics.

=item * Motorola BSR CMTS (ex-Riverdelta)

Displays modem quantities.

=item * NetApp.com storage products

Storage arrays performance and health information.

=item * NetScreen Firewall

Firewall performance statistics.

=item * Oracle 

Database engine statistics.

=item * Paradyne GranDSLAM

xDSL statistics and line status.

=item * Symmetricom NTP appliance

NTP clock statistics

=item * UCD SNMP and Net-SNMP

Memory, CPU, and disk usage information.

=item * Xylan ethernet switches

Port indexing for OmniSwitch and OmniStack ethernet switches.

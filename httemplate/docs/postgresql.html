  <h1>PostgreSQL notes</h1>
<p>
PostgreSQL ships by default with a maximum of 31 character column names.  If
you use arbitrary RADIUS attributes longer than 9 characters, fs-setup will
fail with `duplicate column' errors (in the part_svc table).
Solution: use a different database
engine, or recompile PostgreSQL with 64 character column names.
</p>
Future versions of Freeside will keep all column names under 31 characters to
avoid this problem.

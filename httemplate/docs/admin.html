<ul>
  <li>Open up the root of the Freeside document tree in your web
  browser.  For example, if you created the Freeside document tree in   
  /home/httpd/html/freeside, and your web browser's DocumentRoot is
  /home/httpd/html, open https://your_host/freeside/. Replace
  "your_host" with the name or network address of your web server.
  <li>Select <u>Configuration</u> from the main menu and update your configuration values.
  <li>Next you must create a service definition.  An example of a service
  definition would be a dial-up account or a domain.  For starters, it is
  necessary to create a domain definition.  Click on <u>View/Edit service
  definitions</u> and <u>Add a new service definition</u> with <i>Table</i>
  <b>svc_domain</b> (and no modifiers).

  <li>Now that you have created your first service, you must create a package
  including this service which you can sell to customers.  Zero, one, or many
  services are bundled into a package.  Click on <u>View/Edit package
  definitions</u> and <u>Add a new package definition</u> which includes
  quantity <b>1</b> of the svc_domain service you created above.

  <li>After you create your first package, then you must define who is
  able to sell that package by creating an agent type.  An example of
  an agent type would be an internal sales representitive which sells
  regular and promotional packages, as opposed to an external sales
  representitive which would only sell regular packages of services.  Click on
  <u>View/Edit agent types</u> and <u>Add a new agent type</u>.  Allow this
  agent type to sell the package you created above.

  <li>After creating a new agent type, you must create an agent.  Click on
  <u>View/Edit agents</u> and <u>Add a new agent</u>.

  <li>Set up at least one referral.  Referrals will help you keep track of how
  effective your advertising is, by helping you keep track of where customers
  heard of your service offerings.  You must create at least one referral.  If
  you do not wish to use the referral functionality, simply create a single
  referral only.  Click on <u>View/Edit referrals</u> and <u>Add a new
  referral</u>.

  <li>Click on <u>New Customer</u> and create a new customer for your system
  accounts with billing type <b>Complimentary</b>.  

  <li>From the Customer View screen of the newly created customer, order the
  package you defined above.

  <li>From the Package View screen of the newly created package, choose
  <u>(Add)</u> to add the customer's service for this new package.

  <li>Add your own domain.

  <li>Go back to <u>View/Edit service definitions</u> on the main menu, and
  <u>Add a new service definition</u> with <i>Table</i> <b>svc_acct</b>.
  Select your domain in the <b>domsvc</b> Modifier.  Set <b>Fixed</b> to define
  a service locked-in to this domain, or <b>Default</b> to define a service
  which may select from among this domain and the customer's domains.

  <li><table><tr>
    <td> Create at least POP (Point of Presence) by selecting
        <u>View/Edit POPs</u> from the main menu.</td>
    <th align="left"> OR </th>
    <td>If you are not doing dialup, set slipip to fixed and blank for all your
        Service Definitions which have Table <b>svc_acct</b>.</td>
  </tr></table>

  <li>If you are using Freeside to keep track of sales taxes, define tax
  information for your locales by clicking on the <u>View/Edit locales and tax
  rates</b> on the main menu.

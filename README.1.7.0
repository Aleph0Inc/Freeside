install DBIx::DBSchema 0.29 (or later)

make install-perl-modules
run "freeside-upgrade username" to uprade your database schema

(if freeside-upgrade hangs, try stopping Apache, all Freeside processes, and
 anything else connected to your database, especially on older Pg versions)

If you have any records in the cust_tax_exempt table, you *MUST* migrate them
to the new cust_tax_exempt_pkg table.  An example script to get you started is
in bin/fs-migrate-cust_tax_exempt - it may need to be customized for your
specific data.

make install-docs
 (or "make deploy" if you've got everything setup in the Makefile)

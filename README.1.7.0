run "freeside-upgrade username" to uprade your database schema

(if freeside-upgrade hangs, try stopping Apache, all Freeside processes, and
 anything else connected to your database, especially on older Pg versions)

If you have any records in the cust_tax_exempt table, you *MUST* migrate them
to the new cust_tax_exempt_pkg table.  An example script to get you started is
in bin/fs-migrate-cust_tax_exempt - it may need to be customized for your
specific data.

Optional for better zip code report performance:
CREATE INDEX cust_main16 on cust_main ( zip );
CREATE INDEX cust_main17 on cust_main ( ship_zip );

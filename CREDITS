Thanks to Matt Simerson <matt@michweb.net> of MichWeb Inc. for documentation
and pre-release testing.  Without his help the documentation in 1.0.0
release would have consisted of a single screenfull of text.
(To clear up some misunderstanding, Matt did not write the current
documentation.)

Steve Cleff <cleff@yahoo.com> did the default background image in 1.0.x and
is also the creator of Freeside's elusive mascot, Snakeman, who we hope will
make an appearance in an upcoming version.

Jerry St. Pierre <jstpi@city.timmins.on.ca> did the "SISD" graphic used in
1.0.x and most of 1.1.x.

Mark Norris of Urban Design, Inc. <http://www.urban.com/> did the red "S"
logo for later 1.1.x versions and 1.2.x

Brian McCane? <bmccane@maxbaud.net> contributed PostgreSQL support, HTML
style enhancements and many, many bugfixes.

Cerkit <cerkit@alfheim.net> contributed rsync support and desynced hosts.
His changes will hopefully be included in an upcoming version.

CompleteHOST, Inc. (http://www.completehost.com) funded the development of the
following features:
  - Multiple, separate databases and configurations on one box.
  - Per-customer pricing (custom packages)
  - Internationalization wrt addresses (cust_main, cust_main_county)
Thanks!

<rem@atu.com.au> contributed state/provence listings for Australia.

release.

the print-batch script.

features:

  - Pre-payment support

NetAcces.Net (not netaccess.net) funded the development of the following
features:
  - DNS tracking and export to BIND configuration files
  - Web site virtual host tracking and export to Apache configuration files

Kristian Hoffmann <khoff@pc-intouch.com> contributed Netscape CCK
autoconfiguration support for the signup server.

Jeff Finucane <jeff@cmh.net> send in a bunch of bugfixes (for the sendmail
export, cancel-unaudited.cgi), patches to support billing date modification,
and probably other things too (sorry if I forgot them).

Kenny Elliott <kenny@neoserve.com> contributed ICRADIUS radreply table support,
allowing attributes with ICRADIUS.

Everything else is my (Ivan Kohler <ivan@420.am>) fault.

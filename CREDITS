Thanks to Matt Simerson <matt@michweb.net> of MichWeb Inc. for documentation
and pre-release testing.  Without his help the documentation in 1.0.0
release would have consisted of a single screenfull of text.

Steve Cleff <cleff@yahoo.com> did the default background image in 1.0.x and
is also the creator of Freeside's elusive mascot, Snakeman.

Jerry St. Pierre <jstpi@city.timmins.on.ca> did the "SISD" graphic used in
1.0.x and most of 1.1.x.

Brian McCane? <bmccane@maxbaud.net> contributed PostgreSQL support, HTML
style enhancements and many, many bugfixes.

CompleteHOST, Inc. (http://www.completehost.com) funded the development of the
following Freeside features:
  - Multiple, separate databases and configurations on one box.
  - Per-customer pricing (packages)
  - Integration with Radiator, http://www.open.com.au/radiator
  - Integration with NetSurfer NetKit ISP, http://www.netsurfer.com/
Everything else is my (Ivan Kohler <ivan@sisd.com>) fault.

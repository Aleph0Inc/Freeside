Thanks to Matt Simerson <matt@michweb.net> of MichWeb Inc. for documentation
and pre-release testing.  Without his help the documentation in 1.0.0
release would have consisted of a single screenfull of text.

Steve Cleff <cleff@yahoo.com> did the default background image in 1.0.x and
is also the creator of Freeside's elusive mascot, Snakeman.

Jerry St. Pierre <jstpi@city.timmins.on.ca> did the "SISD" graphic used in
1.0.x and most of 1.1.x.

Mark Norris of Urban Design, Inc. <http://www.urban.com/> did the red "S"
logo for later 1.1.x versions and 1.2.x

Brian McCane? <bmccane@maxbaud.net> contributed PostgreSQL support, HTML
style enhancements and many, many bugfixes.

Cerkit <cerkit@alfheim.net> contributed 

CompleteHOST, Inc. (http://www.completehost.com) funded the development of the
following Freeside features by contracting me for a custom billing system
based on Freeside:
  - Multiple, separate databases and configurations on one box.
  - Per-customer pricing (custom packages)
  - Internationalization wrt addresses (cust_main, cust_main_county)
Thanks!

Mark Williamson <mark.williamson@ebbs.com.au> and Roger Mangraviti
<rem@atu.com.au> contributed state/provence listings for Australia.

Everything else is my (Ivan Kohler <ivan@sisd.com>) fault.

Thanks to Matt Simerson <matt@michweb.net> of MichWeb Inc. for documentation
and pre-release testing.  Without his help the documentation in the first
release would have consisted of a single screenfull of text.

# Steve Cleff <cleff@yahoo.com> did the default background image and is also
# the creator of Freeside's mascot, Snakeman.

Jerry St. Pierre <jstpi@city.timmins.on.ca> did the "SISD" graphic.

Brian McCane? <bmccane@maxbaud.net> contributed PostgreSQL support, HTML
style enhancements and many, many bugfixes.

Everything else is my (Ivan Kohler <ivan@sisd.com>) fault.
